# CPU_Scheduler
The Scheduler Serves as an excellent tool to Showcase the Learnings gained From Operating System
The CPU Scheduler project is a Java-based application designed to simulate and visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms. The project provides a comprehensive platform to understand and analyze how different scheduling strategies work in a real-time operating system.

Key features of this project include:

Algorithm Implementation: The project implements popular CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin (RR), and Multilevel Queue Scheduling. Each algorithm is coded to accurately reflect its theoretical behavior.

Interactive Visualization: The project includes an interactive GUI that allows users to input process details such as burst time, arrival time, and priority. The GUI then visualizes the scheduling process, displaying the Gantt chart for each algorithm and showing how processes are executed over time.

Comparative Analysis: Users can compare the performance of different scheduling algorithms by analyzing metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization. This feature helps in understanding the efficiency and suitability of each algorithm in different scenarios.

User-Friendly Interface: The project is built with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both beginners and advanced users. The GUI is designed using Java Swing, providing a clean and responsive experience.

Educational Value: This project serves as an excellent educational tool for students and professionals looking to gain a deeper understanding of CPU scheduling. By visualizing the scheduling process, users can better grasp complex concepts and see how different algorithms impact CPU performance.

Overall, the CPU Scheduler project is a powerful learning aid and a practical tool for visualizing and comparing different CPU scheduling techniques in a simulated environment.
